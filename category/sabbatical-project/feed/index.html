<p>Hey, so, remember there was that <i>thing,</i> that <i>new thing,</i> that <i><a href="http://trottomatic.com/2012/03/08/my-new-client/">new thing I was working on</a>,</i> and I didn&#8217;t feel ready to talk about it yet? <a href="http://www.ooga-mooga.com/blog/?p=71">I&#8217;m talking about it now.</a> </p>
<p>My big project is this: I&#8217;m taking my existing site for tiki mug collectors, <a href="http://ooga-mooga.com">Ooga-Mooga</a>, and making it better. It&#8217;s getting re-written from the ground up. Still not ready to blab about it completely, as I think it&#8217;s best to wait to talk about new ventures until they&#8217;re done and real and you can poke them with a stick. But OH CARP it&#8217;s already so much fun, and it&#8217;s time to get the Ooga-Mooga users excited about what&#8217;s coming (and help them brace for the changes).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to be honest with you, it&#8217;s nerve-wracking making this announcement. I&#8217;m on pins and needles. I hope folks are able to set aside the very natural (and very understandable) BUT I DON&#8217;T LIKE CHANGE reaction. So far, the response has been warm and good and supportive.</p>
<p>Read my announcement in a post on the embarrassingly stale Ooga-Mooga blog: <a href="http://www.ooga-mooga.com/blog/?p=71">Ooga-Mooga is Ooverdue for an Ooverhaul</a>.<br />
<i>(Seriouslyâ€”there&#8217;s a &#8220;Ooga-Mooga on MySpace&#8221; link in the sidebar. Ow, my 2005 is showing.)</i></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve not been able to say much about my work for ages now, because all of my work has been under pretty tight non-disclosure agreements. Most of you probably know that I work on Pier 9 on San Francisco&#8217;s waterfront, at <a href="http://labzero.com">Lab Zero</a>, and not much more. Lab Zero is a group of consultants: product designers, graphic designers, scrum masters, content shapers, user experience folks, and most of all, software developers. We&#8217;re a sort of strike team of professionals who can drop into a company and make a product or project happen. It&#8217;s a smart move for lots of different kinds of companies, a sort of turbo-charged ramp to the future, a just-add-water team that can make a concept reality (where &#8220;water&#8221; = &#8220;money&#8221;). Much faster than trying to hire a whole new team of people, much safer than distracting an existing team of employees with an untested concept. And dammit, we&#8217;re good.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a lot of fun&#8230; we have great and diverse clients, and the folks who work here are some of the most intelligent, talented, interesting, well-rounded people I&#8217;ve ever worked with. (No small feat; I never thought any place could top working at the Institute for Systems Biology.) I&#8217;m proud to say that Lab Zero does good work, and I&#8217;m lucky to get to be a part of it.</p>
<p>For the past year, my own work slate has been dominated by one Megaproject with one Megaclient. It&#8217;s been fascinating, and has had lots of new and intense challenges, but it&#8217;s also been a lot of very focused-in-one-area work and long hours. My strength is as a generalist, and I needed to stretch my legs a little. So a few weeks ago, I made arrangements with Lab Zero to shift off of the Megaproject for a while. When discussing what my next step should be with Lab Zero&#8217;s CEO, he said he&#8217;d understand if I want to step away for a bit and &#8220;have a life&#8221;. My instant reaction was to point at the Pier and say &#8220;<i>This</i> is my life, I don&#8217;t want to be anywhere else.&#8221; He high-fived me.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Even if you are on the right track, you&#8217;ll get run over if you just sit there.&#8221; &#8211; <em>Will Rogers</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Consulting work can be rather feast-or-famine, and thankfully it&#8217;s been much more of the former than the latter for a while now. I&#8217;ve found myself smack dab in the middle of a unique opportunity: I have enough savings in the bank to support myself while I work on my <i>own</i> project for a while. It&#8217;s the sort of thing I&#8217;ve daydreamed about for years and years. Right this moment, I&#8217;m not only able to make it happen, but do it from Pier 9, surrounded by the best danged coworkers I could imagine, with Lab Zero work as a safety net should my bank account start creaking. So for now, and for a squishy amount of the future, I&#8217;ve hired myself. I&#8217;m making a New Thing. It feels <i>so</i> good. And getting to do it from Pier 9 is&#8230; god, just pinch me.</p>
<p>Rich has continued to do what he always does: believe in me, stand by me and root for me. That guy. He&#8217;s incredible.</p>
<p>So, I <i>still</i> can&#8217;t talk about what I&#8217;m working on. I&#8217;m under my own NDA now. But hopefully some time in the next few months I&#8217;ll have a New Thing I Made to share with you. I can&#8217;t wait. In the meantime, the clock is ticking, and I&#8217;m a coding, designing, planning, creating fool. And I have a big dopey grin on my face.</p>
