		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s great!!! I let my subscription expire because it was getting overwhelming for me to try to keep up with my mugs. Mostly my issue since the mugs were all over the house but mostly in boxes.

Now we&#039;re in a new house with a new bar and I&#039;ll be unpacking all the mugs and setting them up. It will be a fantastic time to resubscribe and get my mugs in order.

I&#039;m not always fond of change but I&#039;m looking foward to seeing the new and improved OM.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mahalo, Marlene!

Maybe try subscribing again... usually these problems are due to temporary screwiness on the PayPal side, so maybe it&#039;ll work now. If not, email me the error you see (send it to humuhumu@ooga-mooga.com), and we&#039;ll get you sorted.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know this will be a big undertaking and you will do a great job with it.  I don&#039;t remember what the issue was before with paying online for a subscription to your site, but I remember that was a block for me.  FYI...I use AOL for email but do have a gmail account that I don&#039;t monitor.  I use Paypal and prefer Firefox.  I look forward to the change and think it is great that you are asking for comments.  Best of luck to you.
