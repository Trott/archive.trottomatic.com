		<description><![CDATA[So glad to hear the happy news of Wanda&#039;s birth and also your commitment to breast feeding. I&#039;m wondering how it&#039;s going on Day 2?   
And please, I encourage you to NOT worry about all the pumping, breastfeeding equipment, at least for a while. You&#039;ve got some weeks of just you and Wanda and I&#039;m a big fan of making that work. 

Let me know if you are open to visits, and I would love to come over. In addition to my grandmother fantasies I was a maternity nurse for a couple of years.  And just returned from Highland Park New Jersey where I got to hang out with my old friend&#039;s grandchild, Mikey, born Nov. 8th. 

Take care, enjoy this wonderful time and another Congrats.
                                                   Deborah G.]]></description>
